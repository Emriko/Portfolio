Ever since I was young I have been very technical and loved to solve problems. Usually starting with the to me most intuitive paths and love to try differnet things until it eventually falls in place

After 3 years of computer science courses and a year long stint at Arlanda airpot I found myself at The Game Assembly, where I truly found my programming passion working with what i love.

In my freetime you will obviously be able to find me playing videogames, but beyond that my main hobby is indoors rockclimbing (hopefully soon to be outdoors as well)
