Ever since I was young, I have been very technical and loved solving problems. I usually start with the most intuitive approach and enjoy experimenting with different methods until everything eventually falls into place.

After three years of computer science courses and a year-long stint at Arlanda Airport, I found myself at The Game Assembly, where I truly discovered my passion for programming while working on what I love.

In my free time, youâ€™ll often find me playing video games, but beyond that, my main hobby is indoor rock climbing, hopefully soon to be outdoor climbing as well!
