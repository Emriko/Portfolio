Screen Space Ambient Occlusion more commonly know as SSAO is a post processing technique that is used to aproximate how occluded a 3D scene pixel would be. This is done to adjust the worlds ambient light accordingly to mimic the effect of the pixels occlusion. This is done as a screen space pass taking in geometry positions and normals, hence the name Screen Space Ambient Occlusion.
