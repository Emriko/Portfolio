      <description> Type Description Engine Unity Timeline 3 days Cooking Grandma is a mutiple award winning Game Jam hosted by The Game Assembly with the theme of &ldquo;Combination&rdquo;. I can hands down say that the work on Cooking Grandma was the most fun I have had with a project durring the stint at TGA.
In just a couple of days the teamwork, creativity, and laughs really carried this project through the door. With no time to say no and just have fun it is very impressive what can be accomplished.

      <description>Gameplay and Graphics programmer
Ever since I was young I have been very technical and loved to solve problems. Usually starting with the most intuitive paths and love to try differnet approaches until the pieces eventualyl fall into place.
After 3 years of computer science courses and a year long stint at Arlanda airpot I found myself at The Game Assembly, where I truly found my programming passion working with what i love.
